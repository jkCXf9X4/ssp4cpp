Visualize the information propagation thru the graph

New information should be generated at the start of the graph, this information should be propagated thru the graph,taking into account the information delay that are specified for nodes and connections

A visual interface should showcase the graph and information propagation thru the graph 

when information is passing thru a node or connection a marker showcasing how far the information has currently passed should be available

Multiple information markers should be able to pass thru a node or connection at the same time

There should be options for start, pause, stop and setting the current speed

All visual elements should be integrated into the same gui

An example graph is specified in the file graph.dot

A separate venv should be used, located in ./venv
Preferred language is Python
