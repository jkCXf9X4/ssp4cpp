# Cyber-Physical Systems Simulator Architecture Overview

## 1. Core Components
- **Model Definition Layer**: Utilize classes from the FMI and SSP schemas to define models, including parameters, signals, and connections.
- **Simulation Engine**: Implement a simulation engine that can handle both model exchange and co-simulation, leveraging the capabilities defined in the FMI standard.

## 2. Data Management
- **Parameter and Signal Management**: Create a robust system for managing parameters and signals, allowing for dynamic configuration and extensibility.
- **Data Storage**: Use a database or file-based storage system to persist model configurations and simulation results.
  
  
## 5. Documentation and Support
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Provide detailed documentation for users, including examples and best practices for model creation and simulation.
- **Community Support**: Establish a community forum or support system for users to share experiences and seek assistance.
