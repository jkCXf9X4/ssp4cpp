| Medium | Representative conditions | Wave speed (m s⁻¹)| What mainly controls|
| Steel (carbon, \~1 % C) | Room-temperature solid bar   | ≈ 5 940 m s⁻¹ | √(Young’s modulus / density) |
| Hydraulic oil (mineral-based) | 25 °C, atmospheric pressure               | ≈ 1 460 m s⁻¹ | √(bulk modulus / density) — varies with temperature, entrained air and the pipe wall compliance if it’s in a line |
|Air flow, even when highly pressurised | 20 °C (e.g. in a 7 bar-g compressor line) | ≈ 343 m s⁻¹** | √(γ R T); at a fixed temperature the speed is almost **independent of pressure**   |



Steel: 5.96m/ms
Hydraulic-oil: 1.46m/ms
Air: 0.343m/ms





# Speed of propagation

## liquids/solids
Newton-Laplace equation:
a = sqrt(K/ρ)

a = wave speed
K = bulk modulus of elasticity
ρ = density

## Gasses

a = √(γ R T)


## Pressure propagation

t=L/a


t = time for pressure to reach other end
L = length of pipe line
