# Model Input/Output Dependency Analysis

## 1. Input/Output Definitions
Each model in the simulation engine will have defined inputs and outputs. For example:
- **Model A**:
  - Inputs: `input1`, `input2`
  - Outputs: `output1`
  
- **Model B**:
  - Inputs: `output1` (from Model A), `input3`
  - Outputs: `output2`

- **Model C**:
  - Inputs: `output2` (from Model B)
  - Outputs: `output3`

## 2. Dependency Graph
The dependency graph can be represented as follows:
```
Model A --> Model B --> Model C
```
This indicates that Model B depends on the output of Model A, and Model C depends on the output of Model B.

## 3. Execution Order
To determine the execution order, a topological sort of the dependency graph can be performed:
1. Execute Model A
2. Execute Model B (after Model A)
3. Execute Model C (after Model B)

## 4. Parallelization Opportunities
Models that do not have dependencies can be executed in parallel. For instance, if there are additional models that do not depend on Model A or Model B, they can be executed simultaneously.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides a framework for managing model dependencies, setting execution order, and evaluating parallelization possibilities in the simulation engine.
