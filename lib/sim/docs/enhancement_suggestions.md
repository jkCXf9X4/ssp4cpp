# Enhancement Suggestions for Cyber-Physical Systems Simulator Documentation

## 1. simulation_engine_class_diagram.md
- **Detailed Descriptions**: Add more detailed descriptions for each class and method to clarify their roles and responsibilities.
- **Integration Notes**: Include comments or notes on how the dependency management integrates with the execution engine to provide a clearer understanding of the workflow.

## 2. architecture_overview.md
- **Expand Simulation Engine Section**: Provide specific functionalities and interactions with other components.
- **Challenges and Considerations**: Add a section on potential challenges and considerations for implementing the architecture, such as performance optimization and scalability.

## 3. model_input_output_dependency_analysis.md
- **Implementation Examples**: Include examples of how to implement the dependency analysis in code or pseudocode to provide practical guidance.
- **Pitfalls in Dependency Management**: Consider adding a section on potential pitfalls in dependency management and how to avoid them.

## Overall Suggestions
- **Consistency in Terminology**: Ensure consistency in terminology across all documents to avoid confusion (e.g., using "Model" vs. "Component").
- **Summary Sections**: Create a summary section at the end of each document to encapsulate key takeaways and action items.
- **Visual Aids**: Use diagrams or flowcharts where applicable to visually represent complex relationships or processes, enhancing understanding.
