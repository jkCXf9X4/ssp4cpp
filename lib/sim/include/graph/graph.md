Note: evaluate if moving to https://lemon.cs.elte.hu/trac/lemon would be beneficiary


The direction of the graph is 

A -> B : A is the parent of B, B is the child of A

input connector -> fmu -> output connectors 

output connectors -> input connector

this would enable switching the "fmu" to the internal dependencies later



# System graph

There is a overview graph showing only the connections between the FMUs

# Detailed graph

There is also a detailed graph showing all connectors

# Direct feedthough graph

A very detailed graph including detailing the dependency connections thru the FMUs
